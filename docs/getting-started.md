# Getting started

## Installation
---

`droid` is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with `pip` in a virtual environment or in a Docker container. The installation is straightforward:

- Install `droid` and the desired Sigma [backends] and [pipelines]
- [Configure](/configuration/) your droid configuration file
- Configure your Sigma [pipelines](/pipelines/)
- Optional: Validate your rules using pySigma validators

If you already have a repository containing all your Sigma rules or if you wish to start from scratch we made available a [repository](https://github.com/certeu/droid-init) to start with `droid` by cloning it.

### Install droid
