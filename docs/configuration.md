# Configure droid

The tool is flexible and requires a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) (.toml) configuration file for various tasks. If you have cloned the [example repository](https://github.com/certeu/droid-init), just open `droid_config.toml`.

The next sections will highlight the config per sections.

### Configure the basics

```toml
[base]

raw_rules_directory = "rules/raw" # (1)!

sigma_validation_config = "validation/validate.yml" # (2)!

sigma_filters_directory = "filters/" # (3)!
...
```

1.  This is the location of the raw rules directory.

2.  This is the location of the Sigma validation config. See the appropriate section below.

3.  Optional. This is the location of the [Sigma filters](https://sigmahq.io/docs/meta/filters.html) rules.

### Configure the platform

Next, configure your platform in the `platforms` section. You will find in one of the [platforms](./platforms/index.md) page the required parameters.

```toml
[platforms.supported_platform]

...
```

???+ warning

    Make sure your platform is supported [here](./platforms/index.md).

### Configure your plaform pipelines

`droid` ease the conversion of the Sigma rules for the desired platform by leveraging the Sigma pipelines. It applies the platforms you desire **by log sources**.

`droid` will look for a match with the Sigma `logsource` fields and the platform pipelines config.

```yaml title="proc_access_win_svchost_credential_dumping.yml" hl_lines="12 13 14"

```toml title="droid_config.toml" hl_lines="4 5"
[platforms.splunk.pipelines.windows_process_access]

pipelines = ["pipelines/splunk_process_access.yml", "splunk_windows"]
product = "windows"
category = "process_access"
```

In the above example, when the Sigma logsource `product` and `category` of the Sigma rules will match the configuration `platforms.splunk.pipelines.windows_process_access`, the Sigma pipelines will be loaded:

- `splunk_windows` is part of the pySigma Splunk [backend](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma-backend-splunk)
- `pipelines/splunk_process_access.yml` is a custom pipeline to apply the necessary transforms

???+ info

    Make sure to install the appropriate pySigma backend for the supported platform. See the [installation](./getting-started.md) section.

```yaml title="splunk_process_access.yml" hl_lines="14 15 16 17"
name: Splunk Windows process access
priority: 100

# Author: Mathieu LE CLEACH
# Purpose if this pipeline:
# Process the windows/process_access rules in Splunk

transformations:
  - id: index_condition
    type: add_condition
    conditions:
      index: windows_sysmon
      splunk_server: "*prod.planet-express.local"
    rule_conditions:
      - type: logsource
        category: process_access
        product: windows

postprocessing:
- type: template
  template: |+
    {{ query }} | table _time,host,user,SourceImage,TargetImage,CallTrace,GrantedAccess
```

???+ info

    If droid does not find a match, it will process the Sigma rule as "non-configured" since the log sources was not configured for the given platform. For the purpose of the automation through CI/CD pipelines, droid will not issue an error exit-code for non-configured log sources.

### Configure the validation

You can validate the Sigma rules on the syntax level by leveraging the pySigma [rule validation](https://sigmahq-pysigma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Rule_Validation.html). It requires a validation configuration file that can be placed in your repository.

```yaml  title="validate.yml"
validators:
    - all
    - -tlpv1_tag
    - -escaped_wildcard
```

???+ note

    Make sure to provide the path to your [droid configuration](#configure-the-basics).
