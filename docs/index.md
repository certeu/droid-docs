# droid documentation

`droid` is a PySigma wrapper allowing an easy adoption of [Sigma](https://sigmahq.io/) and helps enabling Detection-As-Code. The ultimate goal of `droid` is to consume a repository Sigma rules and deploy them on one or multiple platform (SIEM/EDR).

The tool also supports native SIEM/EDR search queries.

## Features

Key features are:

1. **Validate** the syntax of Sigma rules
2. **Convert** them by applying a set of transforms per log source and platform
3. **Search** in logs and report on findings
4. **Test** the rules by leveraging Atomic Red Teamâ„¢ (work in progress)
5. **Deploy** them with any compatible SIEM and EDR
