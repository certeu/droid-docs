### Limitations

Since no stable PySigma backend is currently available, only raw rules are supported.

???+ note

    It is possible to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rules to Sentinel using the the `sm` argument.

### Authentication

Two authentication mode are supported:

- `default`: Default authentication via `az login`
- `app`: Azure Registration App

When using the default authentication:

1. Head to `portal.azure.com` and authenticate using MFA
2. Use `az cli` to fetch the authentication session

When using the Azure Registation App, load the following environment variables:

- `DROID_AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Azure tenant ID
- `DROID_AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID of the registration app
- `DROID_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Azure client secret

The keys `workspace_id` and `workspace_name` are the base workspace declaration but this values can be replaced with the environments `DROID_AZURE_WORKSPACE_ID` and `DROID_AZURE_WORKSPACE_NAME`.
