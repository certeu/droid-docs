### Index detection

???+ warning

    It is necessary to specify the indexes within the Sigma pipeline or it will be defaulted to `logs-*`.

=== "Single index"

    ```yaml
    name: Elastic Windows Process Creation
    priority: 100

    transformations:

    - id: index_set_state
        type: set_state
        key: "index"
        val: "windows-sysmon.*"
        rule_conditions:
        - type: logsource
            product: windows
            category: process_creation
    ```

=== "Multiple index"

    ```yaml
    name: Elastic Windows Process Creation
    priority: 100

    transformations:

    - id: index_set_state
        type: set_state
        key: "index"
        val:
            - "windows-sysmon.*"
            - "windows-sysmon2.*"
        rule_conditions:
        - type: logsource
            product: windows
            category: process_creation
    ```

### Authentication

As of today, the basic authentication is supported. If API Tokens are prefered, feel free to contribute.

- `basic`: Authenticate using username and password

When using the Azure Registation App, load the following environment variables:

- `DROID_ELASTIC_USERNAME` : Elastic username
- `DROID_ELASTIC_PASSWORD` : Elastic password

### Supported Platforms

For Sigma rules both `esql` (ES|QL) and `eql` (EQL) are supported. However since only esql supports correlations rules, it is advised to use esql only. There are no known benefits to using EQL over ES|QL.

For raw rules, both esql (ES|QL) and eql (EQL) are supported. Always use the `raw_language` custom field to specify the language used in the Sigma yaml file.

For non correlation ES|QL rules, the metadata fields are automatically added to the query for better deduplication by the Elastic backend. For correlation ES|QL rules this is not needed since correlation rules are already deduplicated.

| kibana_url             | Yes       | N/A           | The Base URL to your Kibana, since the Security API used goes via Kibana not Elasticsearch                  |

| elastic_ca             | No        | None          | Certificate Chain used on the Elastic host, can also be the same as Kibana, only used when Searching        |
| elastic_tls_verify     | No        | False         | Used to turn on and off Certificate Validation for Elastic Connections, only used when Searching            |
| schedule_interval      | No        | "1"           | Interval at which the alert rule should run                                                                 |

| legacy_esql            | No        | false         | This flag is only if you are on an Elastic Version that needs the square brackets around the metadata info. |
| building_block_prefix  | No        | None          | Optional prefix for Building Block Rules to distinguish from Alert rules, defaults to BB                    |
| alert_prefix           | No        | BB            | Optional prefix to your imported rules to distinguish them                                                  |

### Sigma Custom Fields

The Custom Fields available with the Elastic Integration are:

| Custom Field   | Values          | Description                                                                        |
